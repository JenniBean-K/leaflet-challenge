# Leaflet Challenge: Earthquake Data Visualization

## Overview
The **United States Geological Survey (USGS)** collects a vast amount of data about earthquakes from around the world every day. This project aims to create an interactive visualization tool that displays this earthquake data meaningfully, enabling USGS to better educate the public and government organizations about natural hazards, thereby advocating for increased funding and awareness.

## Features
- Interactive map visualizing earthquake data using **Leaflet.js**.
- Scaled data markers based on earthquake magnitude.
- Color-coded markers reflecting earthquake depth for easy analysis.
- Popups with additional earthquake details upon clicking markers.
- Informative legend to contextualize map data.

### Optional Features (Advanced)
- Overlay of tectonic plate boundaries for correlation with earthquake data.
- Multiple base maps for varied visualization options.
- Layer controls for toggling datasets on and off independently.

## Repository Structure


## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JenniBean-K/leaflet-challenge.git```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

    ```cd leaflet-challenge```

3. Open the index.html file in your preferred browser to view the visulization.

## Data Sources

* [Visit the USGS Website](https://www.usgs.gov)
* [Tectonic plates data: GitHub Repository](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates)

## Instructions

## Part 1: Earthquake Visualization
* Visualize earthquake data fron USGS GeoJSON feed.
* Use [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) to plot data points based on coordinates (latitude ang longitude).
* Style markers to represent:
    * Magnitude: Larger markers for stronger earthquakes.
    * Depth: Darker colors for deeper earthquakes.
* Add interactivity with popups showing details (e.g., magnitude, depth, location).
* Include a legend for easier interpretation.

## Part 2: Advanced Data Visualization (Optional)
* Overlay tectonics plate boundries on the map.
* Add additional base maps (e.g., satellite, topographic).
* Enable separate overlays with layer control.
